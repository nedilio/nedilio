### Hi there 👋

My name is Nelson Izquierdo, and I am a frontend developer with over 4 years of experience. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (also a little bit of TypeScript), and I have experience with a variety of frontend frameworks, including React (with Next.js) and Vue. I am also familiar with a variety of frontend libraries, including jQuery, Bootstrap, and Tailwind.

I have also been having fun working on backend projects with Nodejs.
